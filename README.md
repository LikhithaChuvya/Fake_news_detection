Task Execution
1.Data Exploration
Data Reading:
Start by reading and exploring the textual dataset. Understanding the dataset is essential before building the model. You'll need to inspect the structure of the dataset, including the features, labels, and data format.

2.Model Building
Text Vectorization:
Use the TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical format suitable for machine learning.
PassiveAggressiveClassifier:
Build a machine learning model using the PassiveAggressiveClassifier. This algorithm is particularly effective for online learning and text classification tasks.

3. Model Evaluation
To evaluate the model's performance, we create a confusion matrix and measure its accuracy. The confusion matrix helps us understand true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
